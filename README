Demo of using multiple word-clouds and a scatterplot.

Requires `words.json` to be generated.

Sorts ngrams into three word-clouds, according to whether they occur more often
with one of two (set) n-grams, using straight TF-IDF to determine
font-size within the cloud.

Alongside, displays a scatterplot of each n-gram according to its two tf-idf scores.

Currently, vastly hardcoded - should add user controls:
  * cloud definitions (which n-gram defines the cloud)
  * idf and tf mix ratio for score calculation for each cloud
  * min/max cloud font-size, log-scale factor
  * log-scale factor for scatterplot
  * sector of scatter plot for each cloud
  * cloud n-gram order (alpha, score descending, etc)
  * cloud score threshold
Also needed:
  * context for each n-gram in cloud (which words drove its attribution to the cloud, score, tf, idf)
  * context for each point in scatterplot
  * convert scatterplot to SVG (easier redrawing, mouseover)
